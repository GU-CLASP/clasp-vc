# For local dev we can either:
#  - hardcode the dev key/secret here, OR
#  - rely on LIVEKIT_API_KEY / LIVEKIT_API_SECRET env vars
# The Egress docs allow using env vars instead of these fields.
#
# Since you already have them in .env, we can omit them here and
# let the container read them from env:
#
# api_key: devkey
# api_secret: YOUR_SECRET
